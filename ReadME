This is my vending machine class-

Ashish - to get it to work I had to go through a few steps

I used Java 11 - project needed to be uploaded as a JavaFX

I had to download the JavaFX module then left Click on the project
Select Project and change both settings to Java 11

Then I went to the SDK settings and added JDK 11 to all modules.

Finally I added the module-info.java class and modified it with the following settings
requires javafx.fxml;
    requires javafx.controls;
    opens sample;


My Project starts from the Login screen - Run login.java from intelliJ

Logins that will work -

ronan,password
Ashish,batman
jim, lecturer

Notes * A user must have a customer account to be an admin
* If there is an empty line at the end of any of the .dat files the system will crash.
* to access the CLI login first then click the button

I tested it rigorously so if is doesn't launch please send an email to ronanfobrien@gmail.com
or 13050044@studentmail.ul.ie

Thank you for your time and support this semester
